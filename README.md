# Cross-Stitch Pattern Creator

This project is a "vibe" coding test to create a web application for generating cross-stitching patterns from an uploaded image. The goal is to build a working MVP using Cursor, based on the specifications outlined in the `requirements.md` file. As part of the process, I will be using AI for as many tasks as possibleâ€”this `README.md` and the project's `requirements.md` were both generated by an AI assistant too.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## How to Run the Application for Development

1.  **Build and Start the Container**
    Run the following command in the project root directory:
    ```sh
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```
    This command builds the Docker image, creates a container, and starts the development server in detached mode.

2.  **Access the Application**
    Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

    The application supports hot-reloading. Any changes you make to the files in the `src` directory will be reflected in your browser immediately.

## How to Stop the Application

To stop the running container, execute:
```sh
docker compose down
```
